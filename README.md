# Neighborhood Map

A single page application featuring a map of a chosen neighborhood. Map functionalities include map markers to identify popular locations, a search function to easily filter these locations, a list-view of location names which displays all locations by default, and displays the filtered subset of locations when a filter is applied, and third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations.
